A new version (0.5.1) of Idris 2 has been released. You can download the source
(including generated Scheme and Racket files for bootstrapping) from the
`download page <{filename}../pages/download.rst>`_.

This is a patch release, which fixes some dependency issues in Idris 2 veresion
0.5.1 that required a later than necessary version of Chez Scheme. Version
0.5.1 will bootstrap successfully with Chez Scheme 9.5, and builds with Idris 2
version 0.4.0.
