A new version (0.6.0) of Idris 2 has been released. You can download the source
(including generated Scheme and Racket files for bootstrapping) from the
`download page <{filename}../pages/download.rst>`_.

To build it, you can either use an earlier version of Idris 2 (minimum 0.5.1),
or (the simplest way), run ``make bootstrap`` to build from the generated
Scheme. Full instructions are in ``INSTALL.md`` in the distribution.

Documentation is available `here <https://idris2.readthedocs.org/>`__,
including `API documentation <https://www.idris-lang.org/pages/idris-2-documentation.html>`__.

To get started, you can see:

* `Installation instructions <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/starting.html>`_
  and how to get started
* If you're upgrading from Idris 1, see `Changes since Idris 1
  <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/updates.html>`_

The installation has (so far) worked successfully on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
Please let us know (ideally via the `mailing list
<{filename}../pages/community.rst>`_) how you get on with installing on other
platforms.
