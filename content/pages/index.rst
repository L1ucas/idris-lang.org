Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with dependent
types. Dependent types allow types to be predicated on values, meaning that
some aspects of a programâ€™s behaviour can be specified precisely in the type.
It is compiled, with eager evaluation. Its features are influenced by Haskell
and ML, and include:

* Full dependent types with dependent pattern matching
* Simple foreign function interface (to C)
* Compiler-supported interactive editing: the compiler helps you write code using the types
* where clauses, with rule, simple case expressions, pattern matching let and lambda bindings
* Dependent records with projection and update
* Interfaces (similar to type classes in Haskell)
* Type-driven overloading resolution
* do notation and idiom brackets
* Indentation significant syntax
* Extensible syntax
* Cumulative universes
* Totality checking
* Hugs style interactive environment
