Community Standards
===================

:date: 2020-04-01 11:00

The Idris community is committed to maintaining a welcoming, civil and
constructive environment. We expect the following standards to be observed and
upheld by all participants in any community forum 
(`mailing lists <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/idris-lang>`_,
`GitHub <https://github.com/idris-lang>`_, 
IRC,
`reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/Idris/>`_, etc.).

**Be respectful and inclusive**. Please do not use overtly sexual language or
imagery, and do not attack anyone based on any aspect of personal identity,
including gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, race, age or ability. Keep in
mind that what you write in public forums is read by many people who don’t know
you personally, so please refrain from making prejudiced or sexual jokes and
comments – even ones that you might consider acceptable in private. Ask
yourself if a comment or statement might make someone feel unwelcomed or like
an outsider.

**Give credit**. All participants in the Idris community are expected to respect
copyright laws and ethical attribution standards. This applies to both code and
written materials, such as documentation or blog posts. Materials that violate
the law, are plagiaristic, or ethically dubious in some way will be removed
from officially-maintained lists of resources.

If you believe one of these standards has been violated, please either file an
issue on an appropriate repository, or contact an Idris core developer (at your
discretion). Keep in mind that most mistakes are due to ignorance rather than
malice.

**Be concise**. Constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome, but
high-traffic forums do not generally have the bandwidth for extensive
discourse. Consider writing a blog post if you feel that you have enough to say
on a particular subject.

**Get involved**. The Idris community is built on a foundation of reciprocity and
collaboration. Be aware that community members contribute on a voluntary basis,
so ideas and bug reports are ok, but demands are not. Pull requests are always
welcomed – see the guidelines for contributing to read about how to get
started.

These standards are adapted from the
